      <article id="top"> <h2><code>Stefan Sagmeister Essay</code></h2></article>

      <h2><i><p>What do you believe differentiates Stefan Sagmeister’s work from other typographers/designers and do you consider it to be spontaneous?</p></i></h2>
    
<div class="essaycontainer1"><p>Stefan Sagmeister is famously known as a graphic designer and typographer who co-founded the firm Sagmeister & Walsh with Jessica Walsh. He was born in Austria and is now based in New York where a lot of his present work is produced from his studio. As one of the most recognizable designers in the world; there is no doubt his work has distinguishable characteristics that separate it from other designers. So addressing my question, I plan on bringing these characteristics or features too light throughout. I will firstly focus on Sagmeister’s inclination to typography. Using my in-depth knowledge, it will be my focus to analyze the forms/maxims he creates and give my interpretation on how they have resulted in such success. Using sources such as Sagmeister’s books, I will also select a variety of projects he has committed himself to and deem them too be either as spontaneous as they seem at first glance, or whether there could be more to them than meets the eye. My essay will show a clear understanding of each piece of work selected, aided by a concise argument to support my view.</p>
    
    <p>Having looked at Sagmeister’s work I can’t help but be drawn to his huge inclination to type and how he makes it come so alive. The unorthodox ways he displays his chosen maxims take the type above and beyond its simple form and humanizes the words to intensify the way they make people feel. “To try and touch the heart of the viewer” was a response given when asked about having a philosophy. One instance this rings especially true for me was in the subsection ‘Complaining is silly. Either act or forget’ of the book ‘Things I Have Learned In My Life So Far’.  In this part of the book, Sagmeister tells us about the time he was asked to design a billboard commissioned by the Portuguese beer brand ‘Super Bock’. Using twenty large sheets of newsprint paper, he set to work on the rooftop of his studio, cutting out massive cardboard stencils to create the letters for the quote which were placed on top of the paper. The paper and stencils were left on the rooftop for a week - exposed to the sunlight the paper around the stencils began to yellow; thus leaving the lettering to stand out in large white print. The newsprint was then rolled up and shipped to Lisbon where it was used as intended on a huge billboard. The message on the billboard (exposed to the sunlight) slowly began to turn the same color as the rest of the paper and faded away. </p></div>

    <p>As well as being a notable life quote, I think that Sagmeister uses a gentle, willful manipulation of light and shade to demonstrate his point. Whilst I was reading about the ordeal I couldn’t help but feel that this piece of design on the billboard was a live metaphor in itself. Onlookers in Lisbon who were able to read the sign and had the chance to see the text slowly disappearing over the period of a couple of days, could have interpreted the text on the sign as being peoples thoughts and if they were not acted upon (as quoted) they would gradually disappear into the shade; perhaps symbolising going into the past or old thoughts leaving the targeted audience’s consciences. His whole thought process is outside the box and unlike that of any other designer. Note how he finds an alternative way to display his message, no generic canvas’ or inks used, his design is purposefully affected by the sunlight in real time. In addition to this as shown from the picture above, we can see how systematically Sagmeister’s billboard was laid out and how all the stencil outlines line up perfectly.</p>
    
    <p>Sagmeister often executes unconventional methods and has exploited the physicality of the human body on a number of occasions to communicate his intended message to an audience. One of his most radical pieces of work was In 1999 when Sagmeister had his intern Martin carve the program information of an AIGA poster onto the torso of his body with an x-acto knife. He quotes "For this lecture poster for AIGA Detroit we tried to visualize the pain that seems to accompany most of our design projects". With the extreme cut marks engraved in his skin and the sheer physicality of the act, he powerfully humanizes design and reminds us all how it is something created by and for people - not machines. Sagmeister stated the poster "signalled a turning point for the design profession, away from aspirations of digital perfection toward a higher appreciation for a designers personal mark."  I mean seriously, is there literally any more effective way of putting typography across to other humans. I believe that in doing and saying this, Sagmeister differentiates himself from other designers and acts as a pioneer within his own profession.</p>
    
    <p>This isn’t the only time he has used the human body as a canvas In the name of design either, in 1994 when he announced that he would be setting up his own studio in New York, he photographed himself standing naked for the front of a launch card. In June 2012, a designer named Jessica Walsh who had worked in the studio for two years was made partner where it was therefore agreed to be renamed ‘Sagmeister and Walsh’. In light of the world knowing about the naked photo Sagmeister publicised when announcing the launch of Sagmeister Inc. he had a different standpoint from Walsh about whether it would be seen socially acceptable to do the same again, this time adding a naked woman. Walsh was having none of It and insisted equality (right down to standing on a tower of books to make herself the same height as her new business partner). The duo agreed it was only fitting to do the same again, this time with both standing naked (bar a pair of black socks Sagmeister wore!). This kind of publicity deservedly received a lot of recognition, as well as being daring and bold (and perhaps slightly controversial) it was original and spontaneous in the world of design, which brings me to my next point. </p></div>

                <p>In response to the statement on which this essay is based, is Sagmeister's work really as spontaneous as it comes across to the media? I would argue no, it is not. On the 13th of September, 2008 Sagmeister Inc began the positioning of 250,000 Eurocents in the middle of Waagdragerhof Square in Amsterdam. Perhaps his most well-known piece of work. With the help of over 100 volunteers “the coins were sorted into 4 different shades, and carefully placed over this 300 sqm area, according to a master plan” and put together to create the maxim “Obsessions make my life worse and my work better”. The sculpture took a total of 8 days to complete, afterwards, the coins were left unguarded and free for passers-by to interact with. Within the first day of the masterpiece being complete, the inevitable happened, a local resident spotted someone bagging the coins and taking them away. In an effort to preserve the artwork, the police were rung but swept up the remaining coins, thus ruining the art. </p>
        
        <p>(Duly noting Sagmeister’s ingenuity addressing the interactive side of the artwork) I was initially confused as to why the coins were left unprotected; I mean there is absolutely no way a man of his intelligence (obsessive or not) did not consider the possibility of the coins being stolen/the artwork being vandalized. So why? What could be even more engrossing than hearing about thousands of tourists marveling over this piece of abstract art in one of the most famous European cities every day? Probably hearing about such an ordeal and being intrigued as to why it was swept away within the first day of completion. This project is for me, a result of copious amounts of planning, which in my opinion is almost quite deceiving from how it is portrayed in the media. Readers may see the quote and take this situation as exactly that; that he was not able to fight the compulsion of doing this and couldn’t stop himself without properly thinking it through (and is now left with no physical art to show for it) when in actual fact it was most likely his plan all along. Sagmeister captivates us with these eye-catching projects time and time again (even if initially the end result does come across as looking like a pointless waste of effort or money) and all for the sake of them being interactive designs for the world to enjoy. I think we all as young designers can learn a lot from this approach he has to his work. However, having read more into him and as argued above, I do believe he portrays himself to be more spontaneous than what he actually is.</p></div>

    <p>Having planned to start his experimental year in September 2000 where his studio would do no external work for clients, Sagmeister referenced an American artist Robert Rauschenberg. Rauschenberg stated "that he tried to never come into the studio with an idea" and if he does happen to have one, accordingly goes for a walk to get rid of it. Being very different from how Sagmeister approaches his work, he mimicked Rauschenberg’s idea and later that day tried to begin a little project with no preconceived idea of what he would do. But I would argue that this whole thinking is a preconceived idea in itself - the idea of going into the studio without a preconceived idea. Perhaps Sagmeister mimicked this approach to try and challenge himself outside of his comfort zone to make himself a better designer, which again we can learn a lot from when trying to grow in this industry. However, I do believe that even with challenging himself this way (which is admirable), it is again not as spontaneous as what it may seem. In the sense of appearing to be spontaneous, he almost reminds me of the way Banksy works, targeting seemingly randomly selected places for artwork, but both always with a clear end goal. </p>
    
    <p>Those reading might be wondering, well what can be classed or considered as entirely spontaneous? I'm not saying that everything Sagmeister does is planned to a T, he is a designer after all, it’s his job too be creative and that he does extremely well. A lot of the time Sagmeister uses what little material he has to compose innovative and creative design pieces; which frequently result in original typographic forms that are different to any other designer. I believe that by using this unconventional approach, he differentiates himself from other designers. We as young designers can take from this that sometimes we will have very little too work with and have to adapt our skills to suit the situation. But, having read more into his work, conclusively I feel that his work is not as spontaneous as what people might first think. </p></div>
